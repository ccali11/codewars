/*
In John's car the GPS records every s seconds the distance travelled from an origin (distances are measured in an arbitrary but consistent unit). For example, below is part of a record with s = 15:

x = [0.0, 0.19, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25]
The sections are:

0.0-0.19, 0.19-0.5, 0.5-0.75, 0.75-1.0, 1.0-1.25, 1.25-1.50, 1.5-1.75, 1.75-2.0, 2.0-2.25
We can calculate John's average hourly speed on every section and we get:

[45.6, 74.4, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0, 60.0]
Given s and x the task is to return as an integer the *floor* of the maximum average speed per hour obtained on the sections of x. If x length is less than or equal to 1 return 0 since the car didn't move.

Example:
with the above data your function gps(s, x)should return 74
*/

function gps(s, x) {
  if (x.length <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }
let max = 0;
for (var i = 1; i < x.length; i++) {
  let currentDistance = x[i] - x[i-1];
  let currentAverageSpeed = Math.floor((currentDistance / s)*3600);
  if (currentAverageSpeed > max){
    max = currentAverageSpeed;
  }
}
return max;
}
